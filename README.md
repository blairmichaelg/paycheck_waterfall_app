## 💡 Why PayFlow?

Most budgeting apps are overwhelming. They want you to categorize every transaction, set up complex envelopes, and track everything perfectly. But if you're living paycheck-to-paycheck, you don't need all that—you just need to know:

**"Can I afford this coffee without missing rent?"**

PayFlow answers that question in seconds. Enter your paycheck, add your bills and goals, and instantly see your **guilt-free spending amount**. That's it.

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Guilt-free spending focus**: See at a glance how much you can spend without worry
- **📊 Smart allocation**: Cadence-aware bills with due date priority, paycheck variance cushioning, and bonus income modeling
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Vibrant gradients, smooth animations, dark mode, and fully responsive mobile design
- **💾 Local-first**: All data stays in your browser with localStorage persistence and automatic schema migrations
- **📤 Import/Export**: Back up and restore your configuration as JSON with timestamp-based filenames
- **♿ Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support
- **🧪 Well-tested**: Comprehensive test suite covering allocation logic, UI components, and data persistence
- **🔒 Privacy-first**: No tracking, no ads, no account required—your financial data never leaves your device

## 💰 Financial Precision

PayFlow uses standard JavaScript floating-point arithmetic, which is suitable for personal budgeting and typical paycheck amounts. For amounts under $100,000/month, cumulative rounding errors are negligible (<$0.01).

**Perfect for:**
- Personal budgeting and household finances
- Small business payroll
- Standard consumer finance tracking

**Not recommended for:**
- High-frequency trading or scientific calculations
- Legal/tax calculations with regulatory precision requirements
